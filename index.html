		<h1>Hello Sweet Creature </h1>
		<p> <br> 
			Had to get this out to you first thing - didn't want you to start your big internship day without hearing from me..

			Oh em gee, it's the big day Mooshie! I was literally jumping up and down when I heard the news that you're starting your internship ! Though I can picture that adorable crinkle forming between your brows as those nervous jitters set in. Girlfren', you've got to stop underestimating yourself! 
			I just know once you shake off those first day jitters and get into the swing of things, that stress is gonna fade away...woosh.. I'm manifestin' so hard that the crew you'll be working with is an awesome, fun bunch , more professional and less likely to start quoting vines at random wala grp!!! 
			Like you previous internships..!! 😌🫧✨<br>
			
			I'm wishing every ounce of LUCK in the universe for you today, You're about to kill it and make all us folks back home so proud. Just don't go replacing me with a new work bestie, mmkay? No one can match my ✨sparkle✨! Jking 😹<br>
			
			My heart was rent that night you shed those tears,
			Unable to enfold you in embrace,
			To soothe away your worries and your fears, 
			And with my warm caress, bring peace to grace
			
			To ease the sadness weighing on you now,
			For your sweet smile I care for overmuch.   
			
			Though words may fail when you need comfort most,
			This token bears the passion I profess -  
			A humble bloom wherein my love is housed,
			A fragrant vow that I, your joy, caress.
			
			My dearest Moosh, within its petals see
			How ardently this heart still dotes on thee.
			<br>
			
			I was heartbroken seeing you crying yourself to sleep that night...I wish I could've been there to hold you tight and comfort you. So I coded up a whole website instead, pouring my heart into it just for you 🥺
			
			I really wanted to send you actual flowers too but you know...parents. Didn't want to risk that..then a thought occurred and started with coding a website and as I told you... this will be my first work that I'm going to upload on my portfolio as a website designer...⚡<br>
			
			Mishwa you know the moment you held my hand at that garden and reassured me of this relationship... it's like something in me changed.... Since then, it's always been about "us" rather than just "me." Every new little things I try to learn and do, I do it for us now 🤍
			
			I'm so grateful for your patience when I've been silly and annoyed you. Your forgiveness and understanding mean the world to me. That day you gave me another chance to watch a movie together, I was overjoyed and got emotional 🥺❣️
			You truly understand the significance of those small, meaningful moments, and you place your trust in me through thick and thin. Mishwa, I promise to strive to become a better person for you, to consistently stand by your side, and to nurture what we have, forever and ever..💌
			
			God, I miss our sunrises and sunsets together. I miss holding you close and the taste of your kisses. Counting down the days until I can see you in person again 🌊🤍<br>
			
			Anyway, go get that bread today, Girlfren'! Take all the good energy I'm tossing your way and if ya can, pluck one of those digital flowers I grew, tuck it in your pocket. A lil secret code just for you that no matter where you are, this weirdo's crazy love is right there too.. !! 
			Pucker up buttercup, love you to the moon and back!<br>
			
			Your Shroomsss
